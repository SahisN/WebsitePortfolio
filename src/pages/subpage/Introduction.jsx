            I graduated from California State University Los Angeles with a
            degree in Computer Science, where I discovered my passion for
            software engineering through hands-on projects and student-led
            initiatives. I became especially interested in building tools that
            solve real-world problems and support collaboration. During my
            internship at Lockheed Martin, I supported multiple on-site teams by
            maintaining and troubleshooting critical internal applications,
            while also providing direct technical support to resolve account and
            application issues. Additionally, I served as a leader in the
            Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), where I worked with
            fellow leaders to design and build a mobile app that helped members
            stay engaged with events and opportunities.
